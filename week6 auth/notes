JWT-json web token

there is a problem with stateful tokens

Stateful->we mean that we need to store these tokens in a variable right now(eventually in a database)

the problem is that we need to send request each time to database every time the user wants to hit an authenticated endpoint

solution- JWTs

# JWTs

these are a compact and self contained way to represent information between two parties.they are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications
JWTs are stateless

npm install jsonwebtoken
